Welcome to the case, check out Case description.pdf for the actual case. 

I used poetry to set up the dependencies and test that the utils worked, the pyproject.toml and poetry.lock files are supplied. I'm running python 3.10.
You should also be able to use the supplied requirements.txt if you prefer. If you are using Windows, you may have issues with GDAL, if so, Anaconda can be good option.

Good luck!
